    content: `<p>As specialty coffee continues to grow in popularity, larger corporations are establishing dedicated divisions to meet the increasing demand for high-quality, ethically sourced beans. This shift represents a significant transformation in the coffee industry landscape.</p>
    
    <p>Major coffee corporations are recognizing that the specialty coffee market is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in consumer preferences. The establishment of dedicated specialty divisions allows these companies to maintain their mass-market operations while also competing in the premium segment.</p>
    
    <h2>The Growth of Specialty Coffee</h2>
    <p>The specialty coffee market has experienced exponential growth over the past decade, with consumers increasingly willing to pay premium prices for coffee that offers superior taste, sustainable sourcing, and ethical production practices. This growth has not gone unnoticed by major coffee companies.</p>
    
    <p>Industry analysts predict that the specialty coffee segment will continue to expand, potentially accounting for more than 50% of the total coffee market within the next five years. This projection has prompted larger corporations to invest heavily in building their specialty coffee capabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
    <p>The creation of separate specialty coffee divisions allows major corporations to pursue different strategies for different market segments. While their traditional divisions focus on volume and affordability, specialty divisions can prioritize quality, origin transparency, and unique flavor profiles.</p>`,
